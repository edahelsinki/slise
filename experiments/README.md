# Experiments

The experiments for the papers have been moved into their own branches (so that the experiments are connected to the correct version of the library).
You can find the corresponding experiments here:

- [*Sparse Robust Regression for Explaining Classifiers* (2019)](https://github.com/edahelsinki/slise/tree/conference_experiments/experiments).
- [*Robust regression via error tolerance* (2022)](https://github.com/edahelsinki/slise/tree/robust_regression_experiments/experiments).
- [*Explaining any black box model using real data* (2023)](https://github.com/edahelsinki/slise/tree/explanation_experiments/experiments).
