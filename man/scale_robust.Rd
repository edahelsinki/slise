\title{Robust Scale
A variant of 'scale' that is based on median and mad (instead of mean and sd).
It can handle zero variance without producing nan:s.}
\usage{
scale_robust(x, th = .Machine$double.eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the vector/matrix to normalise}

\item{th}{threshold for the scale being zero}
}
\value{
a list(scaled, center, scale)
